## Predefined functions

WavesContracts standard library not only contains predefined data types and instances, but also predefined functions that can be called. Some of them are pure, others can access blockchain state.


* Native Waves context functions:
   - `addressFromRecipient` : `Option(ByteVector) => addressType`
   - `transactionById` : `ByteVector => Option[Transaction]` - provides tx in blockchain by id
   - `accountAssetBalance`: `(addressOrAliasType, ByteVector) => Long` - provide balance info for any address/asset combination
   - `transactionHeightById`: `ByteVector => UNION(LONG, UNIT)` - provides height of tx in blockchain by id
   - `extract`: `Option[T] => Union(T, None)` - extracts value from any Option, returns value or `None`
   - `isDefined`: `Option[T] => Boolean` - checks if Option contains a value, returns true or false
   
* User's Waves context functions
   - `addressFromPublicKey` : `ByteVector => addressType`
   - `addressFromString` : `String => UNION(addressType.typeRef, UNIT)`
   - `accountBalance`: `addressOrAliasType => Long` - provide WAVES balance info for any address
 
* `DataTransaction`can set/overwrite a typed primitive value for a key on account of sender. These fields can be accessed from         WavesContracts via:
    
   - `getInteger`:`(accountAddress: ByteVector, key: String) => Option[Long]`
   - `getBoolean`:`(accountAddress: ByteVector, key: String) => Option[Boolean]`
   - `getBinary`:`(accountAddress: ByteVector, key: String) => Option[ByteVector]`
   - `getString`:`(accountAddress: ByteVector, key: String) => Option[String]`
  
* Crypto functions:
	- `sigVerify`:`(body: ByteVector, signature: ByteVector, pubKey: ByteVector) => Boolean`
	- `keccak256`,`blake2b256`, `sha256` : `ByteVector => ByteVector`
	- `fromBase58String'`, `fromBase64String'`: `String => ByteVector` 		
	- `toBase58String'`, `toBase64String'`: `ByteVector => String` 	
    - `base58`: ByteVector constructor that accepts a String literal and uses single quotes `base58'...'`
