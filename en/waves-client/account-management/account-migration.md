# **How to migrate your Beta and Lite client accounts into Waves wallet**

As you may know, Wavesplatform had several developmend stages. We had Waves Lite client as one of the very first wallet version. Then we created a completely redesigned application, and for several months the wallet had a Beta status. Finally, we proud to inform you that the official application has come out of Beta.

These instructions are relevant only for online versions used in the web browsers and only if you run into problems with account transferring, since the new online application should do it in automatic mode.

For owners of desktop applications, there is no need to perform any actions with their accounts, since the application will just automatically update everything that is needed.

At the same time, you can always restore your account using a backup copy of the phrase. More detailed instruction available here - [How to restore access to my account](waves-client/account-management/restore-an-account.md)
